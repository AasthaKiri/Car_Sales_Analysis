# Car Sales Analysis:

## Problem Statment: 
This project aims to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth. It includes YTD Total Sales, YTD Average Price, and YTD Car Sold with their differences and growth respectively. It also shows visuals of YTD weekly sales, Sales based on Body Type and Color, and their trends.

The data was extracted and meticulously cleaned utilizing Power Query. DAX metrics were then applied to derive insightful calculations. Finally, the data was visualized to effectively present the findings, empowering business stakeholders to make informed decisions.
